# Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:
* Which is the preferred payment method?
* Which category and sub-category products are top sellers?
* Which months have higher sales?
* Which state provides high sales and profits


# Results/Findings
The analysis results are summarized as follows:

# Recommendations
Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:

* Focus on expanding and promoting products in the Category of clothing driving the highest sales and in the sub-category Printers which gives the highest profit.
* Top 10 customers can be given points as loyalty rewards which can act as encouragement for other customers as well. 
* Focus on states such as Maharastra, Madhya Pradesh which are key drivers of sales
